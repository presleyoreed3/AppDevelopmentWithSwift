# AppDevelopmentWithSwift
Working through Apple's Swift Textbook


# Chapter 1

Through the course of Chapter 1 I learned about the syntatic differences between Swift and the other languages that I know. On top of that it gave a fairly conprehensive early intro into Xcode and all of the basic editig tools. 

By the end of the chapter I had created a light app that switched the IOS device screen from full white to full black. While it had a single button toggle at one point that was removed to enable the app to switch states no matter where you tap on the screen.

# Chapter 2

The first section of this chapter discussed the ins and outs of strings, which by and large reflect what I have know about strings after learnig java.
